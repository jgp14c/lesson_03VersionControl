            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What exactly is version control and how do we use it in todays modern era? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or multiple files over a period of time so that you can always go back to an earlier saved version to revise or restart a project. Many people decide to to use a method of version control that is ver simple, yet effective. They simply copy their files into another directory. This method however is error prone in that it is easy to forget which directory you have saved your files to on the different directory.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Centralized version control is the solution to the earlier problem of version control in which multiple people could not access, view, and change a certain file or files. In centralized version control, a number of clients can check out a file and work on it. This has been the new standard of version for the last couple of years. the advantages of this version control is that everyone has the ability to see what each other has done on the project. Also the administration has the ability to monitor and control over which person is able to do what to the project or projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is a distributed version control system and how exactly does it work? With a distributed version control system, the clients don’t actually receive a snapshot of the latest version. Instead, they fully mirror the repository. This is useful incase the server dies, any of the clients work can be copied back up to the server to restore it back to normal. These “clones”, as they are called, is in fact a full backup of all the data files. The distributed version control system also works well with having multiple remote repositories meaning you will be able to collaborate with different people and groups.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is Git and how did it all start? The story of how git came to be starts with the background for many great operating systems, devices, and many other things. It all started with Linux. The Linux kernel is an open source software that was created in the early 90’s as a way to help advance the software capabilities of programmers everywhere. At first Linux used a DVCS called bitkeeper, but this system fell apart and Linux was forced to come up with their own form of a DVCS. Thus Git was born, and it offered free, fast, and reliable ways to safely store data for your projects.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What are some of the basics of Git and how is Git different. Git is different than the other VCS’s in the way it thinks and observes its data. Most of the other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. Git however thinks of the information it is storing as more of a snapshot. Whenever you save your work, Git for the most part takes a picture of what exactly the file looks like. If the file was not changed, then the snapshot will not be added to the database because it already exists. But if the snapshot does in fact exist, then the new snapshot will be added to the data base for storage.</p>
