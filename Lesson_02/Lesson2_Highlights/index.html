            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What exactly is an IP address and how are they used in modern computer technology? An IP address is a nmercal address that is assigned to every device connected to the internet. IP addresses are used for many reasons, one of the most important reasons is to properly identify a computer and its user. The computer identifies itself through a series of identifying numbers. The IP address successfully identifies itself by using a series of thirty two binary code numbers, called bites. These thirty two binary numbers are broken up into four seperate groups of eight. These groups of eight are called a byte, one byte equlas eight bits. These bytes help to created a binary identification number for a computer or network. This personal identification code can be useful in solving cyber crimes, but it does not always help to produce the culpret. Many of todays common household and business routers will often only display just on IP address that is shared by many people across the business, organization, or family. This makes it nearly impossible to tie in a single person with a crime or an act. But while the IP address does in fact have some flaws with total security, the benefits of identification out weighs the cons.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What exactly is the internet and how does it work to connect people from all across the world? The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that allow users to successfully communicate to anyone from around the world. The basics of how the internet works is through a giant network system. When two or more electronic devices are connected so that they can communicate, they then become part of a network. The internet is a huge network connecting electronic devices from all around the world. In order for the internet to work properly, computers need to be able to talk to one another. And just like us humans, computers have a language for communicating with each other. Computers mainly send information over the internet using the internet protocol (IP). Sending infomraiton over the internet using the internet protocol is like sending someone a book page by page through the mail. Individual pages are sent, but until they are all connected in the final destination, the message will not make sense. The devices that are responisble for transporting internet data are called routers. These routers do not need to be programmed differently to deal with different types of data, they simply need simply need to know the internet protocol and they will send them forward.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Encryption</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What is encryption how is it used to help protect the privacy of millions of people a day on the internet? Encryption is the act of hiding the content of a message or file so that others cannot view or get a hold of sensitive information. Encryption is not a guaranteed item for total confidence. A frequent technique to bypass encryption is to capture the message before it even gets encrypted. An example of this is a stealth trojan horse program. This program is sent to you view email or is actually installed on a persons computer. The virus then monitors the users keys that are being presses and even the screen. One of the ways that encryption works is through public key encryption. This works on the basis that their is a pair of keys that two users have, one is public and one is private. The sender then requests a copy of the public key. the sender then encrypts the message using the recipients public key. The message is sent and the recipient decrypts the message by using the public key and the private key together.  While we mentioned that encryption is not something that is impossible to hack, it does however add another layer of protection to users.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What exactly is email and how is it used to benefit people today? Email, also known as electronic mail, are messages sent by one sender to one or more recipients. The way the mail does this is through SMTP (simply mail transfer protocol) which is built using the internet protocol. When you are creating an email to be sent on the web it is transferred to an outgoing mail server using the SMTP. It is then transferred from one of those email servers to another until it reaches its final destination. Email servers are able to send out this email by using the Domain Name System (DNS). The domain name system includes information about which servers are in charge of carrying each part of the information. When the message arrives at the email server for the receiver, it will remain on that server until the user physically deletes the item. When we discuss email another important item to discuss is email security. There are two main ways to prevent email from being intercepted by this parties. One is to secure the communication between the email servers. The other way to do it is to encrypt the contents of the emails.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Deep Packets</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What are deep packets and how are they used on the internet? Data on the internet is sent in what we call packets. Packets are small block of data that has a header that describes its origin and destination. This information allows the network equipment to determine the best path to send the packet. Originally network equipment only would look at the origin and destination information. But with the increase of cyber crimes and malware, owners decided that they needed to look at more details of each packet before sending or receiving them. Initially, firewalls could only block a packet traveling form a certain origin to a certain destination. Using these criteria, you could block all incoming service requests to your office network, school network, etc. But the firewall is not in fact a sure thing for stopping viruses. It is impossible for a firewall to distinguish legitimate packets from malicious ones based solely on origin and destination details. This is why modern network equipment looks deeper into the packet to determine if the content is going to be allowed or not. Devices that started going deeper into packets to determine if they were viruses are called intrusion prevention systems (IPS).</p>
